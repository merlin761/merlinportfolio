This course focuses on foundational computing skills that support the work of a security analyst.  It begins with an introduction to computer operating systems, followed by a closer exploration of Linux, an operating system commonly used by security professionals. By the end of this course, learners will be able to use the Linux command line through the Bash shell to navigate and manage the file system and to authenticate and authorize users, and they will also be able to use SQL to communicate with a database. 


By the end of this course, you will: 
- Explain the relationship between operating systems, applications, and hardware.
- Compare a graphical user interface to a command line interface.
- Identify the unique features of common Linux distributions.
- Navigate and manage the file system using Linux commands via the Bash shell.
- Use Linux commands via the Bash shell to authenticate and authorize users.
