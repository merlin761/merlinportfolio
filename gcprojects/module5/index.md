This is the fifth course in the Google Cybersecurity Certificate. These courses will further explore the importance of protecting organizational assets from threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. They will also continue to develop an understanding of asset classification and how to use the National Institute of Standards and Technologyâ€™s (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), as well as security controls, to protect assets and mitigate risk. Additionally, learners will gain an understanding of how to develop a threat actor mindset to help protect assets from ever-evolving threat actor tactics and techniques.

By the end of this course, you will: 
- Learn effective data handling processes.
- Discuss the role of encryption and hashing in securing assets.
- Describe how to effectively use authentication and authorization. 
- Explain how common vulnerability exposures are identified by MITRE.
- Analyze an attack surface to find risks and vulnerabilities.
- Identify threats, such as social engineering, malware, and web-based exploits.
- Summarize the threat modeling process.
