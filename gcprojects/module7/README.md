This is the seventh course in the Google Cybersecurity Certificate. In this course, learners will be introduced to the Python programming language and learn how to apply it to a security setting to automate tasks.  First, learners will focus on key foundational Python programming concepts, including data types, variables, conditional statements and iterative statements.  Next, they will learn to work effectively with Python by developing functions, using libraries and  modules, and making their code readable.  Following this, they will explore working with string and list data.  A final component of learning to automate tasks through Python will be an exploration of how to import and parse files, and then the course will conclude with a focus on debugging.

By the end of this course, you will: 
- Explain how the Python programming language is used in cybersecurity.
- Write conditional and iterative statements in Python.
- Create new, user-defined Python functions.
- Use Python to work with strings and lists.
- Use regular expressions to extract information from text.
- Use Python to open and read the contents of a file.
- Identify best practices to improve code readability.
- Practice debugging code.
