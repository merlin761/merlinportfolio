##  Google Cybersecurity Certificate Projects


To start my journey i decided to obtain the Google CyberSecurity certificate where i learned about:!!!!!

### [1) Automate Cybersecurity Tasks with Python](/module7/README.md)<br/>

On this module i was able to develop skills in Automation where they thought me parse files and structure their contents and also about the different types of debbuging tecniques. in addition to:
- How the Python programming language is used in cybersecurity.
- Write conditional and iterative statements in Python.
- Create new, user-defined Python functions.
- Use Python to work with strings and lists.
- Use regular expressions to extract information from text.
- Use Python to open and read the contents of a file.
- Identify best practices to improve code readability.

### [2) Play It Safe: Manage Security Risks](/module2/README.md)<br/>

For module 2  i learned about: 

- The common threats, risks, and vulnerabilities of business operations.
- Understand the threats, risks, and vulnerabilities that entry-level cybersecurity analysts are most focused on.
- The purpose of security frameworks and controls.
- The confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) triad.
- The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) framework.
- Explore and practice conducting a security audit.
- Use a playbook to respond to threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.

### [3) Tools of the Trade: Linux and SQL](/module4/README.md)<br/>

Linux and SQL where other tools i was able to learned and also how to put it to work by being able to:

- Explain the relationship between operating systems, applications, and hardware.
- Compare a graphical user interface to a command line interface.
- Identify the unique features of common Linux distributions.
- Navigate and manage the file system using Linux commands via the Bash shell.
- Use Linux commands via the Bash shell to authenticate and authorize users.
- Describe how a relational database is organized.
- Use SQL to retrieve information from a database.
- Apply filters to SQL queries and use joins to combine multiple tables.

### [4) Sound the Alarm: Detection and Response](/module6/index.md)<br/>

This module taught me about:
- The lifecycle of an incident.
- The tools used in documentation, detection, and management of incidents.
- Analyze packets to interpret network communications.
- Perform artifact investigations to analyze and verify security incidents.
- Identify the steps to contain, eradicate, and recover from an incident.
- Determine how to read and analyze logs during incident investigation.
- Interpret the basic syntax and components of signatures and logs in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) tools.
- Perform queries in Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools to investigate an event.


### [5) Assets, Threats, and Vulnerabilities](/module5/index.md)<br/>

On this module we discussed:
- Effective data handling processes.
- The role of encryption and hashing in securing assets.
- How to effectively use authentication and authorization. 
- Explain how common vulnerability exposures are identified by MITRE.
- Analyze an attack surface to find risks and vulnerabilities.
- Identify threats, such as social engineering, malware, and web-based exploits.
- Summarize the threat modeling process.


### [6) Connect and Protect: Networks and Network Security](/module3/README.md)<br/>

By the end of this module i was abe to have a better and more clear understanding of 

- The structure of different computer networks.
- Illustrate how data is sent and received over a network.
- Recognize common network protocols.
- Identify common network security measures and protocols.
- Explain how to secure a network against intrusion tactics.
- Compare and contrast local networks to cloud computing.
- Explain the different types of system hardening techniques.
